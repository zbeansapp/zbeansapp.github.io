Throughout the year, Arturo attends different coffee conferences and events throughout Ecuador. At the events, Arturo meets and connects with new farmers, allowing us to expand our farmer base. After, farmers will send Arturo samples of their coffee, which Arturo grades, roasts, and cups. Once Arturo has completed his analysis, he will report his findings to us. It is through this process that we are able to continue adding new farmers to our team on a yearly basis!</p>\n<p>Once the summer rolls around and harvests are in full swing, Arturo will contact each of our farmer partners and coordinate our yearly coffee purchase. Arturo works through logistics with the farmers, helping them get their coffees to Marie and Fabricio’s processing facility in Pinas, Ecuador. Once at the processing facility, Arturo performs one final inspection, ensuring the green coffee beans are dried properly and representative of the sample we received earlier in the year! </p>\n<p>Since day one, Arturo has bought into our vision of building a direct trade, sustainable supply chain. He has trusted our mission and vision, and for that, we are grateful. It is safe to say, without the friendship, loyalty, and hard work of Angel Arturo Penarreta Romero, Z Beans would not be where it is today! </p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Arturo Pennareta","tags":["farmer"],"coordinates":[-79.5165744,-3.5114309],"location":"Zaruma, Ecuador","coordinateString":"3° 30' 41\" S, 79° 30' 60\" W","altitude":null,"process":null,"flavor":null,"otherCrops":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/arturo-penarreta/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/angelmorena-manuelsanchez/"},"frontmatter":{"name":"Angel Morena & Manuel Sanchez","tags":["farmer"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/carlos-ochoa/"},"frontmatter":{"name":"Carlos Ochoa","tags":["farmer"]}}}}}
