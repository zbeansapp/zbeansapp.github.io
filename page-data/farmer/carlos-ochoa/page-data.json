On our initial trip, we had the opportunity to spend time with Carlos and his wife, touring his plantation and enjoying Ecuadorian coffee. His plantation is full of specialty Arabica varieties. He has ample shade for his plants, including robust orange trees. Most notably, his plantation has a beautiful waterfall that Carlos has been able to utilize to irrigate his plantation. </p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Carlos Ochoa","tags":["farmer"],"coordinates":[-79.55138889,-3.69305556],"location":"Guizhaguina, Zaruma, Ecuador","coordinateString":"3° 41' 35\" S, 79° 33' 5\" W","altitude":5000,"process":"Washed","flavor":"Citrus and dark chocolate notes","otherCrops":"Orange Trees, Cacao"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/carlos-ochoa/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/angelmorena-manuelsanchez/"},"frontmatter":{"name":"Angel Morena & Manuel Sanchez","tags":["farmer"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/downtown-macon/"},"frontmatter":{"name":"Downtown Macon","tags":["cafe"]}}}}}
