Arturo has tended to Edgar’s plantation for 2 years now, focused on producing high quality, specialty coffee. Over the course of their long time friendship, Arturo had always expressed an interest in starting his own coffee plantation. So, when the opportunity came about for Edgar to begin growing and harvesting coffee, he knew who to turn to. During the summer of 2018, Arturo introduced Shane to the plantation. However, the plants were still young - they needed another year before they could produce any coffee. So, the following year, we had the opportunity to purchase Edgar’s first batch of coffee. The sweet yet bold product first arrived to The States the summer of 2019.\n\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"800\"\n              height=\"400\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PYu65_Oe1XI?rel=0\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              allowfullscreen\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Edgar Mora","tags":["farmer"],"coordinates":[-79.5165744,-3.5114309],"location":"Zaruma, Ecuador","coordinateString":"3° 30' 41\" S, 79° 30' 60\" W","altitude":4900,"process":"Washed and Honey","flavor":"Dark chocolate with notes of citrus and banana","otherCrops":"Bananas, Plantains, Cacao, Orangs, Lemons"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/edgar-mora/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/downtown-macon/"},"frontmatter":{"name":"Downtown Macon","tags":["cafe"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/gonzalo-suin/"},"frontmatter":{"name":"Gonzalo Suin","tags":["farmer"]}}}}}
