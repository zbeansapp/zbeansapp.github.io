Gonzalo Suin is one of those farmers! Located in Pinas, Ecuador, close to the plantation of Jose Capa, Suin’s plantation is beautiful. He has different varieties of Arabica plants and sufficient shade to slow the maturation process. He cares for his plantation unlike any other farmer we have seen, constantly caring around his machete. After a catastrophic fire burnt down his home in 2018, we decided to help out any way we can, raising money for him and donating basic supplies that would make his 2019 harvest easier. One of those supplies - a new, sharp machete.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Gonzalo Suin","tags":["farmer"],"coordinates":[-79.74138889,-3.71555556],"location":"Pinas, Ecuador","coordinateString":"3° 42' 56\" S, 79° 44' 29\" W","altitude":4000,"process":"Washed and Natural","flavor":"Chocolate notes","otherCrops":"Orange Trees"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/gonzalo-suin/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/edgar-mora/"},"frontmatter":{"name":"Edgar Mora","tags":["farmer"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/herman-ochoa/"},"frontmatter":{"name":"Herman Ochoa","tags":["farmer"]}}}}}
