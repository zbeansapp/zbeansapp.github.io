From there, Diego and Shane exchanged WhatsApp numbers and immediately formed a friendship. After Shane connected Diego with Arturo, Diego sent Arturo a small sample of his coffee.This sample was inspected and looked over for defects — however, no issues were found! When Shane and Carter went to Ecuador in July of 2019, they roasted the coffee and tried it. Immediately, they knew they had an incredible coffee on their hands - a coffee grown with care, love, and hope. A week later, the three of them traveled to Las Lajas, Ecuador, to visit Diego and his family. The plantation was even more impressive than they anticipated - beautiful citrus trees enveloped the well-groomed plants and the slopes provided just the right amount of steepness. The first batch of The Jaya Family’s coffee arrived to The States on August 17, 2019.\n\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"800\"\n              height=\"400\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UMOEpkye67Y?rel=0\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              allowfullscreen\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>","frontmatter":{"name":"The Jaya Family","tags":["farmer"],"coordinates":[-80.1503,-4.185761111],"location":"Las Lajas, Ecuador","coordinateString":"3° 47' 59.136\" S, 80° 4' 50.844\" W","altitude":4000,"process":"Washed and Honey","flavor":"Rich flavor with bold aftertaste","otherCrops":"Oranges, Grapefruits, Bananas"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/jaya-family/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/st-francis/"},"frontmatter":{"name":"St. Francis Hospital","tags":["cafe"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/william-martillo/"},"frontmatter":{"name":"William Martillo","tags":["farmer"]}}}}}
