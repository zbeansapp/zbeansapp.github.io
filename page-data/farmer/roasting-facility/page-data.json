But, with our new roasting facility in downtown Macon, we now have a reliable foundation for roasting, importing, and distribution. The facility is located at the back of the Lofts at Silver, beneath the Piedmont Brewery. While some may call the 2200 square foot space a basement, we call it the roastery! </p>\n<p>At the roastery, we have two coffee roasters. A Diedrich IR-12 that allows us to roast 25lbs every 10 minutes - just a few steps up from the Popcorn popper which put out 11ounces every hour! We also have a small experimental, blend roaster - a Primo 7lb roaster, which allows us to create unique blends for businesses! </p>\n<p>Furthermore, we have a storage room where we hold all of the coffee we import from Ecuador. The room is large enough to hold up to 30,000lbs! </p>\n<p>Also, we have two office spaces for our corporate offices. Here, we hold our team meetings and work on fine tuning the business. </p>\n<p>Last but certainly not least, we have our production area where our production and delivery team make bags, package them up, then prepare for distribution. </p>\n<p>One of the unique opportunities the basement brought forth was the ability to hold events. While we have rented out the space for private corporate parties and meetings, we have used it to hold events of our own - namely, the Roast Your Own Blend event. Here, participants have the opportunity to specially blend their choice of washed, honey, and natural processed beans. If you want your own personal blend but don’t have the time to come to one of the RYOB events, don’t worry - you can create your own blend on the website, and we will blend it, roast it fresh, and ship it to you!</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Roasting Facility","tags":["cafe"],"coordinates":[-83.628143,32.835118],"location":null,"coordinateString":null,"altitude":null,"process":null,"flavor":null,"otherCrops":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/roasting-facility/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/ramiro-pauta/"},"frontmatter":{"name":"Ramiro Pauta","tags":["farmer"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/st-francis/"},"frontmatter":{"name":"St. Francis Hospital","tags":["cafe"]}}}}}
